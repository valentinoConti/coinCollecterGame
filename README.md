## coinCollecter: Game

This is a really really simple _HTML5 game_ created with _pure javascript_, no libraries.

Basically, in this game you just gotta collect coins moving the mouse around the screen, but you gotta do it really really fast, because if you are not fast enough you will run out of time, you can collect clocks to help you out with that (but again, you gotta be fast!)

You can play it without downloading the project [clicking here to play it in Kongregate.com](https://www.kongregate.com/games/valeenconti/coin-collecter) 

(the code here doesn't include the code for connecting to the API of that web, because it may change with the time and because it doesn't add anything to the game itself)
### Instructions: 
**M** to toggle music/sound  
**N** to change your character  
**ENTER** to start the game  
_Move the mouse_ to play the game  
Better to play with your fingers on the _ASD_ keys ;)

To win, you should get 900 points.
